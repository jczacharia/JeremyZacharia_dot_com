        Hello! My name is Jeremy Zacharia. First, and above all, I am a creator. I first discovered my
        interest for creating when I asked my father how people develop cartoon animations, video games,
        websites, and other technological ways of creating. He told me to look into software engineering. This
        sparked my interest in computers, both hardware and software. My childhood dream was to have the
        capacity to create my own electronic projects from start to finish; an application that solves an
        engineering or business problem; prototyping the system on a bread-board, incrementally develop the
        embedded software and eventually design hardware schematics and PCB component placement. Then, develop
        a web-based application to visualize the data gathered from hardware sensors and seeing the project
        come to life! From this full-stack development inclination, I sought after a career in Electrical and
        Software Engineering. Check out the rest of my website to see my skills, interests, and experience
        that I have gained over my life.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
      <p>-Jeremy</p>
